# Last Light
A 2D Platformer, designed using Unity, in which the player must control the character and their companion, Pixie, in order to climb the lighthouse and escape the darkness inside. Pixie acts as your main light source, allowing you to scout the abyss while also acting as a beacon to distract enemies and light torches. This game was created on a team of 6 for the Ludum Dare 54 Game Jam.

### How to Play
To play the game, download the Windows folder and run the "Game Jam.exe" file. A zip file can be found on our [official submission page](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/54/last-light).

#### Controls:
 - Use **WASD** to move and jump
 - **Left click** on the screen to cast the pixie to that location (You can only throw the pixie if it's recalled)
 - **Right click** anywhere or walk over the pixie to recall it
 - Watch out for enemies! You only have 3 lives, so make them count!
 - The pixie can be used to light torches, activate platforms, and distract enemies (blue torches will harm enemies)

### About
This game was built in 48 hours and submitted for the Ludum Dare 54 Game Jam. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/AriveIT/Game-Jam-Game). For the competition, I participated in a team of 6 with 3 other programmers and 2 artists.

The game was designed around the theme for the Game Jam: "Limited Space". Based on the theme, our team wanted to create a game that felt cramped, offering players little room to work with. From there, we came up with the idea of limited light using the darkness as our main method to keep the player enclosed and the rest of the mechanics followed shortly after.

### My Role
For this project, I was mainly in charge of the following features:
1. The tile map system used to create obstacles and platforms
2. Creating the scripts and prefabs for moving platforms (both activated and constant platforms)
3. Designing the Start Screen, Level Select Screen, and the Win Screen
